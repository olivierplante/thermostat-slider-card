# Changelog

## 1.1.0

**Add and remove from the UI** — Thermostat Slider Card now uses Home Assistant's config flow. Install from Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration. The Lovelace resource is automatically cleaned up when you remove the integration, so uninstalls no longer leave a dangling `/thermostat_slider_card/thermostat-slider-card.js` 404 in the browser console.

**Automatic YAML migration** — Existing users with `thermostat_slider_card:` in `configuration.yaml` are migrated automatically on first restart. Nothing breaks. The YAML line is no longer needed and can be removed at your convenience; a one-time deprecation warning in the logs will remind you.

**Documentation restructure** — The README is now scoped to what the card does and how to install it. Configuration, theming, and interaction details moved to dedicated pages under `docs/`.

**README screenshot path fixed** — The card screenshot now uses an absolute URL so it renders correctly inside HACS, not just on GitHub.

## 1.0.5
